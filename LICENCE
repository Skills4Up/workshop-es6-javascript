## Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and the public can rely upon. The following considerations for the public also apply to creators and the public should follow them in order to make use of the licensed material.

1. **Public License Considerations**: This is a summary of the CC-BY-NC-4.0 License. The complete license is available at: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode)

2. **Scope of license**: Under this license, you are free to:
   - **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
   - **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material

   The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.

3. **License conditions**: You must follow these terms:
   - **Attribution** — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
   - **NonCommercial** — You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
   - **No additional restrictions** — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

4. **Notices**: You do not have to comply with the license for elements of the material in the public domain or where your use is permitted by an applicable exception or limitation.

5. **No warranties are given**. The license may not give you all of the permissions necessary for your intended use. For example, other rights such as publicity, privacy, or moral rights may limit how you use the material.
